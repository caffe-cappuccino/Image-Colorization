Transform grayscale images 🖤 into vibrant color 🌈 using **reinforcement learning**.  
The RL agent **learns step by step** which colors to apply, bringing black-and-white photos to life — all inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jheelamH/Image-Colorization.git
cd Image-Colorization
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually ensure:

* 🐍 Python 3.x
* 📒 Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* 🔢 NumPy, OpenCV
* 🧠 TensorFlow / PyTorch *(if used for the RL agent)*
* 📊 Matplotlib

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open **`Image_Colorization.ipynb`** → run cells step by step → watch grayscale images turn colorful ✨

---

## 🛠️ Inside the Notebook

* 🖤 **Preprocessing** → prepare grayscale images
* 🎯 **RL-based Colorization** → agent decides which colors to apply where
* 🎨 **Inference** → generate final colorized outputs
* 📊 **Visualization** → side-by-side comparisons (grayscale vs. colorized)

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

* Use **high-contrast grayscale images** for better coloring.
* Train the RL agent longer for complex images.
* Tweak the **reward function** to improve realism.
* Experiment with **learning rates and architectures** for richer results.

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* Build a **GUI / web interface** for interactive colorization.
* Enable **batch processing** for multiple images at once.
* Explore advanced RL methods like **actor-critic or PPO** for more nuanced coloring.
* Add **automatic evaluation metrics** to compare colorized vs. ground truth images.
