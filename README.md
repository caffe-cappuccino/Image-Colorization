# 🎨 Image Colorization

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** implementation of **Image Colorization**, where grayscale images are automatically converted into their colorized versions using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
Image-Colorization/
│── Image_Colorization.ipynb   # Main Jupyter Notebook
│── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies (if any)
│── README.md                  # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jheelamH/Image-Colorization.git
cd Image-Colorization
```

### 2. Install dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, make sure you have these basic packages:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow / PyTorch *(depending on your implementation)*
* Matplotlib

### 3. Run the Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open **`Image_Colorization.ipynb`** and run the cells step by step.

## 📊 Usage

Inside the notebook, you will find:

* **Data preprocessing** – preparing grayscale images.
* **Model training / loading** – building or loading the colorization model.
* **Inference** – generating colorized images.
* **Visualization** – comparing grayscale and colorized outputs.

## 🖼️ Example

| Input (Grayscale)          | Output (Colorized)           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![Gray](./sample_gray.jpg) | ![Color](./sample_color.jpg) |

*(Replace with actual results from your notebook)*

## 📚 Technologies Used
