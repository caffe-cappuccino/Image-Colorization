Bring grayscale images 🖤 back to life 🌈 using **deep learning + computer vision**.  
This project demonstrates how an AI model can **learn colors** and apply them to black-and-white photos — all inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jheelamH/Image-Colorization.git
cd Image-Colorization
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually ensure you have:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* NumPy, OpenCV
* TensorFlow / PyTorch
* Matplotlib

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open **`Image_Colorization.ipynb`** → run cells → watch grayscale turn colorful ✨

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

* 🖤 **Preprocessing** → prepare grayscale input images
* 🤖 **Model Training / Loading** → build or load a CNN for colorization
* 🎨 **Inference** → generate colorized versions
* 📊 **Visualization** → side-by-side comparisons (gray vs. color)
